A simple JavaScript based game, that allows you to choose from three categories (Easy|Medium|Hard) to display a certain pool of randomly selected towns from the SMPEarth Server for Minecraft (https://www.smpearth.com).
I have also came to the realization, that cheating with the developer tools is very easy, but as long as this is not competetive in any way, go ahead play as you want to play.
